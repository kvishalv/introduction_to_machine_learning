Description task 2

Approaches tried: 
- NuSVC, NaiveBayes, KNN, Nearest Centroid, Linear Discriminant, Quadratic Discriminant, Stochastic Discriminant, SVM, Stochastic Gradient, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree. 
=> KNN and Quadratic Discriminant were promising

Data Pre-Processing:
- Scaling and removing outliers. 

=> removing outliers did not offer significant improvement
=> scaling for mean did

- Removing redundancy. 
=> x9 correlates with x6^2
=> x8 with x3
=> x14 with x10
=> x12, x13 and x15 seem to be noise
=> Removing them improved the result

Optimizing Parameters:
- GridSearchCV as in previous task, which improved the result slightly. 

Methods:
- hierarchical structure
=> Did not improve our result. 

- Voting approach using KNN & Quadratic Discriminant
=> improved a bit 

Cross Validation:
- Manual bootstrapping
- Automatic using GridSearchCV with 10 fold cross validation
=> No apparent overfitting

Summary: Voting classifier with KNN and Quadratic Discriminant.
