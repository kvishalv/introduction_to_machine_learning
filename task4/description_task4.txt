Description task 4

Data processing:
- Sparse data
- dropping of columns (0, 3, 5, 14, 26, 35, 40, 65, 72, 95, 99, 104, 124),
- Scale with mean and std
- Select 59 percentile (determined by grid search cv)

Supervised learning (labelled data only)
- Neural networks
-- Multi-layer perceptron, 1-3 layers (1 with high epoch performed the best)
- NuSVC & SVC
- KNN

Semi-supervised learning:
- Approach: learn labels with sklearn LabelSpreading, then perform supervised learning approach on top
-- LabelSpreading: kernel ‘rbf’, gamma=2.0

Results
- Above hard base line with labelled data only (good public score)
- Private score might be based on unlabelled data, thus added a pre-supervised learning step

Validation by splitting data into train and validation set
